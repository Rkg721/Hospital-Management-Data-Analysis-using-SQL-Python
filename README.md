## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow for a Hospital Management System using SQL and Python (Jupyter Notebook).

By analyzing 5 structured datasets â€” Appointments, Patients, Doctors, Treatments, and Billing â€” I extracted business-critical KPIs, insights, and recommendations to improve operational efficiency and revenue optimization.

## Tech Stack

SQL â†’ Window functions, CTEs, joins, aggregations

Python (Jupyter Notebook) â†’ Pandas, Matplotlib

Excel/CSV â†’ Data handling & exports

BI Storytelling â†’ Turning raw data â†’ management-ready insights

## Key Business Insights

Total Revenue: â‚¹5,09,844

Appointment Failure Rate: 50.5% (28.5% cancellations, 22.0% no-shows)

Top Specialization: Pediatrics (â‚¹2,31,180 | 45.3% of total revenue)

Best Performing Branch: Eastside Clinic (â‚¹94,874 from completed appointments)

Financial Risk: â‚¹3.08 Lakhs (60.5% of bills) pending/failed payments

Patient Experience Gap: Avg. 142 days from registration to first appointment

## Recommendations

Reduce Appointment Failures â†’ Automated SMS/email reminders, online rescheduling, cancellation fee policy

Optimize Cash Flow â†’ Digital payment gateway, collection follow-up team, payment plans for high-cost treatments

Grow High-Revenue Segments â†’ Expand Pediatrics capacity, replicate Eastside best practices across branches

Enhance Patient Experience â†’ Bring down first appointment wait time from 142 days â†’ <30 days

## How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git hub -  (https://github.com/Rkg721/Hospital-Management-Data-Analysis-using-SQL-Python)
cd Hospital_Management_Analysis


Open SQL queries in /sql/hospital_analysis_queries.sql using any SQL client (SQLite/Postgres/MySQL).

Run Jupyter Notebook for Python analysis:

jupyter notebook notebooks/hospital_analysis.ipynb


Review KPIs & charts (auto-generated with matplotlib).
